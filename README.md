# PaintCalulator
This is a test Paint calculator I built for a submission for a placement opportunity.  

This is a very simple caluclator that takes inputs from users and print out the results

user will have to input their area dimensions 

and then the program will print out three diffrent answers 

first the area 

then the amount of paint needed 

then the volume
